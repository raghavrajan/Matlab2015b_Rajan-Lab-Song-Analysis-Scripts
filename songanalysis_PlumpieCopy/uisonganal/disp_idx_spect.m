%display that sucker
%because of matlab bug, cannot zoom correctly on image that has axis = xy
% get message about warped color image, and boundaries of image columns jump around
%as work around, invert image data and display with images default reversd y axis
%this has the consequence of screwing up y axis lables, which plot from smallest to largest along the y axis direction
%funky workaround is to display frequency with negative numbers

hold on
